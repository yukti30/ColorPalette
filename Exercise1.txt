🧪 Exercise 3: Color Palette Selector
🎯 Goal:
Let the user pick a color from a palette and show the selected color in a preview box.

📘 Concepts Covered:
Passing functions as props

Updating parent state from child

Props + useState together

🛠️ Components:
✅ ColorOption (child)
Accepts:

color prop (e.g. "red")

onSelectColor function prop

Renders a small button or box that shows the color

On click → calls onSelectColor(color)

✅ ColorPalette (parent)
Renders a group of ColorOptions

Maintains the selected color in useState

Shows a preview box with the selected color

🔧 Sample Usage:
tsx
Copy
Edit
<ColorPalette colors={["red", "blue", "green", "orange"]} />
And inside ColorPalette, you’ll render each color using ColorOption.

✅ Expected Output:
A few colored buttons/boxes

Clicking one updates a preview area (a box or div) with that background color
